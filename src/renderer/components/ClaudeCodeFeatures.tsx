/**
 * This page is a history monitor for Claude Code status. It is analogous to a process monitor in Windows.
 * It will show all interactions with Claude Code as well as any steps that Claude Code is taking
 * It will clearly mark which actions are currently in progress and which are completed
 * 
 * 
 * We will represent what is happening in a comprehensive & extensible data structure.
 * We will build different visualizations on top of it depending on the user's needs.
 * Initially the visualization will be a simple list of events shown in a tree-view
 *
 * 
 * The data structure will be constructed from the webhook events that Claude Code generates
 * These events are described in detail at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks
 * 
 * A key observation is that these webhook events are generated as a user interacts with Claude Code and as Claude Code takes actions
 * This means that the fundamental unit of organization is a "session" that a user starts.
 * Within a "session" a user enters one or more "prompts". Claude Code will then take actions based on the prompts in the form of "tools" or "subagents"
 * Subagents are essentially inovcations of Claude Code with a specific prompt.
 * 
 * Based on the above, we can construct a data structure of a series of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The root node for each DAG is the session.
 * Child nodes can be attached to the root node as additional events are created. While running, this application should maintain a list of root nodes, one per session.
 * It is an error condition if there is no way to correlate an event's information to an existing session DAG, unless it is an event which indicates the start of a new sessions (and thus, it is a new root node to be added to the list)
 * 
 * What will be key for maintainability of this data structure is not tying the implementation of it too heavily to the structure of the underlying data. By that, I mean that nodes should be flexibly defined and then key/value pairs attached to it to describe what it contains. Do not implement something like "StopEventNode"/"StartEventNode"/etc. 
 * Some information I think every node will need include:
 *     - id - this is a unique identifier for the node to ensure that we can do lookups/comparisons/searches between nodes. The value itself is irrelevant as long as it is unique amongst all nodes. A UUID would suffice
 *     - Time it was received - this is what time we saw the event
 *     - Event type - this is the type of the event. This should be from an enum of expected events. If we ever receive an unknown event type, we should record a warning but not throw erros and handle it gracefully.
 *     - Raw body - this is the raw data of the entire event. It will allow us to reconstruct anything in the future without having lost data
 *     - Session id - this is the session that this event is included in
 *     - Parent id - the id value of the node of which this node is a child. Will be blank for root nodes but all other nodes should have it defined
 *     - child id - this is a _list_ of id values for all child nodes of this node. This list will be empty for nodes that are "leafs" in the graph 
 *     
 * The implementation should be done in such a way that it is straightforward to add additional properties and information to the nodes without requiring massive refactoring> I expect to add more in the future.
 * 
 * The API for the data structure should include a few things at a minimum:
 *   getSessions() - return all sessions that we are tracking
 *   addSession(session_id) - create a new root node for a new session with the given id
 *   getNode(id) - returns the node with a given id.
 *   addChild(parent_node, child_node) - adds a relationship between the two specified nodes
 *   printNode(node_id) - print a textual representation of the contents of the node specified by the given id
 *   printNode(node) - print a textual representation of the contents of the node object passed in
 * 
 * @returns
