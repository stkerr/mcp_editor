# Webhook Implementation Analysis Task

## Context
You are tasked with analyzing the webhook implementation in the MCP Editor codebase. The webhook system is designed to receive events from Claude Code and track subagent activities.

## Key Files to Analyze

### Core Implementation
1. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/src/main/webhook-server.ts` - Main webhook server implementation
2. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/src/main/index.ts` - Integration point for webhook server
3. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/src/shared/types.ts` - Type definitions including SubagentInfo

### Frontend Components
1. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/src/renderer/components/WebhookTest.tsx` - UI component for testing webhooks
2. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/src/renderer/components/HooksConfig.tsx` - Configuration UI for hooks

### Testing and Documentation
1. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/test-webhook.js` - JavaScript test script
2. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/test-webhook.sh` - Shell test script
3. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/webhook-relay.sh` - Webhook relay script
4. `/Users/stkerr/Code/Personal/mcp_editor/WEBHOOK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Troubleshooting guide

## Key Findings from Initial Search

### WebhookServer Class Structure
- Located in `src/main/webhook-server.ts`
- Main class: `WebhookServer` (line 17)
- Key methods:
  - `handleWebhookEvent` (line 85) - Processes incoming webhook events
  - `processWebhookEvent` (line 166) - Core event processing logic
  - `parseHookInput` (line 113) - Converts Claude Code hook format to internal format

### Event Types
The system handles three event types:
1. `subagent-stop` - When a subagent completes its task
2. `tool-use` - When a tool is used (creates new subagent)
3. `notification` - General notifications

### WebhookEvent Interface (line 8)
```typescript
interface WebhookEvent {
  sessionId: string;
  toolInput?: any;
  toolOutput?: any;
  eventType: 'subagent-stop' | 'tool-use' | 'notification';
  timestamp: string;
  transcriptPath?: string;
}
```

## Analysis Tasks

Please analyze the following aspects:

1. **Event Flow Analysis**
   - How webhook events are received and processed
   - The transformation from Claude Code hook format to internal format
   - How events are routed to different handlers

2. **Subagent Lifecycle**
   - How subagents are created from tool-use events
   - How subagent completion is detected (PostToolUse with Task tool)
   - The matching mechanism between start and stop events

3. **Data Extraction**
   - How task descriptions are extracted from events
   - Token usage and duration tracking
   - Tool usage tracking

4. **Integration Points**
   - How the webhook server integrates with the Electron main process
   - IPC communication with the renderer process
   - Database storage via `addSubagentInfo`

5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - How the system handles malformed events
   - Missing description handling
   - Duplicate event prevention

6. **Security Considerations**
   - CORS configuration
   - Request validation
   - Port binding (localhost only)

## Expected Output

Provide a comprehensive analysis including:
1. A detailed explanation of the webhook event flow
2. Identified strengths and weaknesses in the implementation
3. Potential improvements or optimizations
4. Any security concerns
5. Documentation gaps or inconsistencies

## Additional Notes
- The webhook server runs on port 3001 by default
- Events are expected to come from Claude Code's hook system
- The system uses a queue mechanism for storing subagent information
